          &quot;I am Syeda Alisha Zehra, a passionate developer and designer skilled in
          creating elegant web solutions. My expertise includes TypeScript,
          JavaScript, React, and Next.js. I have a strong foundation in TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and I specialize in creating dynamic, responsive, and intuitive web applications. Over the years, I&apos;ve honed my skills through various personal and academic projects, gaining experience with both front-end and back-end development.
  
          Currently, I am expanding my expertise in Next.js, a framework I&apos;m using for building modern, scalable web applications. Though I&apos;ve worked on several projects using Next.js, I&apos;m continuously learning to unlock its full potential, aiming to integrate AI and other cutting-edge technologies.
  
          Teaching and Mentorship
  
          I&apos;m also deeply passionate about teaching coding and have a special interest in helping young learners understand the foundations of programming. I currently mentor students who are learning Python, TypeScript, and JavaScript, and I take pride in making complex concepts accessible and enjoyable. One of my projects is teaching kids how to create games like the Fruit Catcher game using Python Turtle.
  
          In addition to my coding projects, I am preparing to teach React to students and help them build the skills needed to create dynamic, interactive web applications.&quot;
